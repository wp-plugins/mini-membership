Get a Mini Membership site to attract more Subscribers.Give your audience Private Content read access when they sign up.


== Description == 

WordPress by default restricts user role subscriber from reading private content.Give subscribers private content read access and turn your WordPress site into a mini membership site.Let visitors signup as Subscriber to read Private Content or call it Members Only Content.This plugin also blocks dashboard access for subscribers(even if they try /wp-admin/), hides admin bar from front end, and adds an optional widget to let people register, log in and log out of your site.No fancy features, smart and simple plugin to attract more subscribers.**Before Using Please Read The Installation Instructions First**.

**Note**: If you want to send newsletters to your subscribers containing private content links, you may like another Free plugin I developed.It redirects non-logged users to the login page when they follow a link to private content.WordPress by default redirects all non-logged users to a 404(content not found) page when they follow a link to private content, and that confuses members.Check out [Private Content Login Redirect](http://wordpress.org/plugins/private-content-login-redirect/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Can we still post private content that's only readable by user role contributor and above? =

By activating Mini Membership you are giving private content read access to subscribers.Subscribers can read all private content just like other user roles.Using private content just to interact with authors and editors? I think email and private forums are better options for that.Mini Membership is for those sites where the admin wants to post both public and private content, but also wants to let people register easily and read awesome private members only content.You get more subscribers, which means more connections. :)
